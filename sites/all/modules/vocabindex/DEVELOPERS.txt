This file addresses some issues Vocabulary Index developers should know about
before they start coding.

================================================================================

- Create notes with the following syntax: "// NOTE: This is a note. -Username."
  This allows for easy finding and it makes clear who wrote the note.

- $vi objects contain all properties stored in the {vocabulary} table along with
  the following Vocaulary Index-specific properties:
   - path
     Type: string; The path to a VI page.
   - view
     Type: integer; How the VI is being displayed. Value matches the values of
     the VOCABINDEX_VIEW_X constants.
   - node_count
     Type: boolean; Whether node counts are calculated for terms or not.
   - type
     Type: integer; Either VOCABINDEX_VI_PAGE or VOCABINDEX_VI_BLOCK.
   - enabled
     Type: boolean; For every vocabulary a VI page and a VI block are stored
     in the database. The enabled property is set to TRUE if a VI is actually
     enabled.

- vocabindex_update_status() checks if the Vocabulary Index table has been
  updated to the latest version to prevent errors from popping up. If you write
  a hook_update_N() implementation, put the following line in there and remove it
  from the previous implementation it was in:
  <?php variable_del('vocabindex_schema_update', TRUE); ?>

- Vocabulary Index does not follow the Drupal coding standards for the full hundred percent. Periods used for string concatenation are surrounded by spaces at both sides. This behaviour is according to the Drupal 7 coding standards. This decision has been made, because multiple branches are maintained at the same time; it makes it easier to share code between them.
