Migrate 2.0 Beta 3
==================
Features and enhancements

- #989200 - Support "dynamic" migrations. Changes to be aware of:
  All modules implementing migration classes must now implement hook_migrate_api()
    (see migrate_migrate_api() for an example).

    machine name rather than class name.

  Migration class names are no longer required to end in 'Migration'.
